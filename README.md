# Student Course Management System
Developed a Java-based backend application simulating a university-level student course management system using Object-Oriented Programming principles. The system models core academic entities like students, professors, courses, and departments, incorporating inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and enums for a modular and extensible design. 

**Key Features:**

-> Defined an abstract Person class and implemented specific roles like Student and Professor, both inheriting core attributes and behaviors.

-> Implemented a UserLogin interface to support role-based login functionality for users.

-> Enabled course creation with unique course codes, instructors, and departmental alignment using the Course class and Department enum.

-> Allowed students to enroll in and view their courses, and professors to view and assign courses using dynamic ArrayList storage.

-> Applied encapsulation through getter methods and constructor initialization for secure data handling.

-> Used a Main driver class to simulate user logins, enrollments, and course displays.

**Technologies Used:**
Java · OOP · Interfaces · Inheritance · Enums · Collections (ArrayList)
