# StudentCourseManagementSystem
Developed a Java-based backend application simulating a university-level student course management system using Object-Oriented Programming principles. The system models core academic entities like students, professors, courses, and departments, incorporating inheritance, polymorphism, interfaces, and enums for a modular and extensible design.
